## üî¥ CURRENT ISSUES (Blocking)

### Issue #1: EP0 IN (GET_STATUS) Timeout + Device Firmware Regression

**Status**: üî¥ OPEN - Blocking oscilloscope GUI

**Severity**: Critical (blocks BMI30.200.py GUI)

**Latest Status** (2025-10-21 ~19:00):
- ‚úÖ IF#2 (Vendor Bulk) **STILL PRESENT** in lsusb
- ‚úÖ Interfaces: 3 (IF#0 CDC Control, IF#1 CDC Data, IF#2 Vendor Bulk)
- ‚úÖ IF#2 has alt=0 (no endpoints) and alt=1 (with EP 0x03 OUT, EP 0x83 IN)
- ‚úÖ EP0 OUT commands **WORKING**: SET_PROFILE, START_STREAM, STOP_STREAM all succeed
- ‚ùå **EP0 IN (GET_STATUS) BROKEN**: errno 110 timeout on EVERY attempt
- ‚ùå **IN endpoint (0x83) NOT TESTED**: Cannot test due to PyUSB alt=1 switch error

**Description**:
After device developer flashed new firmware, the Vendor Bulk interface (IF#2) has disappeared.

**Current State** (After Flashing):
```
‚úÖ Device Configuration 1:
  Interface 0: CDC Control (class=2)
    EP 0x82 (IN, Interrupt)

  Interface 1: CDC Data (class=10)
    EP 0x01 (OUT, Bulk)
    EP 0x81 (IN, Bulk)

  Interface 2: Vendor Bulk (class=255)
    alt=0: bNumEndpoints=0 (initialization state)
    alt=1: bNumEndpoints=2
      EP 0x03 (OUT, Bulk)  ‚úÖ
      EP 0x83 (IN, Bulk)   ‚úÖ
```

**Problem Details** (CONFIRMED PERSISTENT 2025-10-21 ~19:00):
```
DEVICE STATUS CHECK (Re-verified):
- lsusb: Device 009 (was Device 008 - re-enumeration after testing)
- bNumInterfaces: 3 ‚úÖ
- Endpoints visible: 0x03 (OUT), 0x83 (IN) ‚úÖ

Test Results (CURRENT):
[tx] ‚úÖ EP0 OUT commands WORK:
    - SET_PROFILE (0x14) ‚úÖ (errno=0, successful)
    - Additional attempts: All succeed
    
[ep0] ‚ùå GET_STATUS (EP0 IN) - CONSISTENT FAILURES:
    - Attempt 1: errno 110 timeout ‚úó
    - Attempt 2: errno 110 timeout ‚úó
    - Attempt 3: errno 110 timeout ‚úó
    - 100% failure rate
    
[rx] ‚ùå IN endpoint (0x83) NOT TESTED:
    - Cannot establish alt=1 via PyUSB (error: "Other error")
    - Unknown if endpoint would receive data
```

**Timeline**:
- 18:34 - GET_STATUS: WORKING (returned 64 bytes) ‚úì
- 18:45 - GET_STATUS: BROKEN (errno 110 timeout) ‚úó
- 18:50 - GET_STATUS: Confirmed broken across multiple attempts ‚úó
- 19:00 - GET_STATUS: STILL BROKEN, device re-enumerated but issue persists ‚úó

**GitHub Status**:
- Last firmware commit: 2025-10-21 10:53 (Added BMI30.stm32h7.elf)
- Firmware deleted: 2025-10-21 15:37 (Delete firmware/BMI30.stm32h7.elf)
- No new firmware or updates since deletion ‚è≥

**Previous Test Results** (2025-10-21 ~18:34):
```
[ep0] ‚úÖ STAT v1 readable (64 bytes, alt1=True, out_armed=True)
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:

‚úÖ **What Works**:
- IF#2 USB descriptor correctly defined (class 255, 2 alt settings)
- alt=0‚Üíalt=1 switching functional (vendor SET_ALT command)
- Bulk endpoints (0x03/0x83) active on alt=1
- EP0 GET_STATUS working (STAT v1 readable)
- Firmware compilation and flashing successful

‚úÖ **Fixed**:
- Device firmware **EP0 Bulk OUT handler** (control endpoint request handler)
- Commands now send successfully: SET_PROFILE (0x14), START_STREAM (0x20), etc.
- errno 5 I/O Error no longer appears

‚ùå **What's Broken Now** (PERSISTENT REGRESSION):
- **CRITICAL**: EP0 GET_STATUS (IN) is completely broken - 100% timeout rate (errno 110)
  - Persists across device re-enumeration
  - Does NOT recover even after STOP_STREAM command
  - Suggests: Hardware EP0 IN pipeline stuck or firmware handler crashed
- IN endpoint (0x83) cannot be tested due to PyUSB alt=1 switch error ("Other error")
  - Workaround needed: Use vendor SET_ALT control command instead of PyUSB
- Device firmware appears unstable or in corrupted state

**Likely Device Firmware Issues** (Updated):

‚úÖ **Fixed** (as of 2025-10-21 ~17:37):
1. EP0 OUT data phase handler - NOW WORKING
2. Control transfer implementation - NOW WORKING
3. Command request validation - NOW WORKING

‚ùå **Needs Fixing**:
1. IN endpoint (0x83) data transmission not active
2. DMA/FIFO configuration for Bulk IN transfers
3. Data buffering/queuing after START_STREAM
4. May need additional initialization command
5. Check if device firmware actually triggers data stream on START_STREAM

**Test Command**:
```bash
lsusb -d cafe:4001 -v | grep "bNumInterfaces\|Interface"
```

**Action Required (Device Developer)**:
1. ‚úÖ Verify firmware source has IF#2 Vendor Bulk descriptor
2. ‚úÖ Check if firmware compilation includes all USB descriptors
3. ‚úÖ Verify flash operation completed successfully
4. ‚úÖ Check device logs for initialization errors
5. ‚úÖ Re-compile and re-flash if needed
6. ‚úÖ Confirm device shows 3 interfaces on fresh USB connect

**Workaround** (temporary):
- Use `USB_receiver.py --plot-fast` with CDC mode (slower, ~20 FPS instead of 200)
- Or wait for device developer to fix firmware

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå BMI30.200.py GUI cannot find IF#2 (blocks oscilloscope display)
- ‚ùå Cannot achieve ~200 FPS visualization
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can fall back to CDC mode but with reduced performance

**Notes**:
- IF#2 briefly appeared in previous firmware iteration, then disappeared
- This suggests firmware update may have reverted or failed
- Both Vendor Bulk and CDC code paths exist in project (confirmed in `usb_vendor/usb_stream.py` and `USB_receiver.py`)

### Action Items (For Device Developer)

**Firmware Status**:
- ‚úÖ New firmware flashed successfully (2025-10-21 ~17:37)
- ‚úÖ IF#2 Vendor Bulk interface now present
- ‚úÖ Endpoints (0x03/0x83) accessible
- ‚ùå EP0 control request handler broken

**Issue Found**:
All EP0 Bulk OUT control commands fail with errno 5 (I/O Error).
This is a **firmware bug** that needs fixing, not a flashing issue.

**Action Required** (device developer):
1. ‚úÖ Review device firmware source code
2. ‚úÖ Find EP0 control OUT request handler implementation
3. ‚úÖ Check:
   - Data phase handling for control transfers
   - Request parsing/validation logic
   - Endpoint HALT/stall conditions
   - Interrupt/DMA conflict on EP0
4. ‚úÖ Fix the bug (likely in stm32 USB driver configuration)
5. ‚úÖ Re-compile firmware
6. ‚úÖ Re-flash device
7. ‚úÖ Test: `python3 BMI30.200.py` should connect and stream data

**Expected Output After Fix**:
```
[open] ‚úÖ IF#2 found
[alt] ‚úÖ alt=1 set
[ep0] ‚úÖ STAT v1 readable
[tx] ‚úÖ Commands succeed (no errno 5!)
[stream] ‚úÖ Data flowing from IN endpoint
[gui] ‚úÖ Oscilloscope displays at ~200 FPS
```

## üü° RESOLVED ISSUES (For Reference)

### Issue #0: EP0 Commands Failing with I/O Error (RESOLVED)

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED (IF#2 was briefly working)

**What Happened**:
- When IF#2 appeared, EP0 bulk OUT commands failed with errno 5
- All command types failed (START_STREAM, STOP_STREAM, SET_PROFILE, SET_FULL_MODE)
- STAT v1 reads worked fine (proving EP0 partially functional)

**Resolution**:
- This was firmware issue on device side
- When IF#2 disappeared, this issue became moot
- Current priority: Get IF#2 back (Issue #1)
