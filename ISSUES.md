## üî¥ CURRENT ISSUES (Blocking)

### Issue #1: EP0 Bulk OUT Commands Failing (Device Firmware Bug)

**Status**: üî¥ OPEN - Blocking oscilloscope GUI

**Severity**: Critical (blocks BMI30.200.py GUI)

**Update**: New firmware HAS BEEN FLASHED (2025-10-21 ~17:37)
- ‚úÖ IF#2 (Vendor Bulk) now appears in lsusb
- ‚úÖ Interfaces: 3 (IF#0 CDC Control, IF#1 CDC Data, IF#2 Vendor Bulk)
- ‚úÖ IF#2 has alt=0 (no endpoints) and alt=1 (with EP 0x03 OUT, EP 0x83 IN)
- ‚úÖ alt=1 switching works (vendor SET_ALT command succeeds)
- ‚úÖ STAT v1 polling works (EP0 GET_STATUS returns 64 bytes)
- ‚ùå **EP0 Bulk OUT commands all fail with errno 5 (I/O Error)**

**Description**:
After device developer flashed new firmware, the Vendor Bulk interface (IF#2) has disappeared.

**Current State** (After Flashing):
```
‚úÖ Device Configuration 1:
  Interface 0: CDC Control (class=2)
    EP 0x82 (IN, Interrupt)

  Interface 1: CDC Data (class=10)
    EP 0x01 (OUT, Bulk)
    EP 0x81 (IN, Bulk)

  Interface 2: Vendor Bulk (class=255)
    alt=0: bNumEndpoints=0 (initialization state)
    alt=1: bNumEndpoints=2
      EP 0x03 (OUT, Bulk)  ‚úÖ
      EP 0x83 (IN, Bulk)   ‚úÖ
```

**Problem Details** (CRITICAL UPDATE 2025-10-21 ~18:50):
```
USB Endpoint Test Results (LATEST):

REGRESSION DISCOVERED: GET_STATUS is NOW COMPLETELY BROKEN

[tx] ‚úÖ EP0 OUT commands WORK:
    - SET_PROFILE (0x14) ‚úÖ
    - START_STREAM (0x20) ‚úÖ  
    - STOP_STREAM (0x21) ‚úÖ
    
[ep0] ‚ùå GET_STATUS (EP0 IN) - ALWAYS TIMEOUT:
    - BEFORE any commands: timeout ‚úó
    - AFTER SET_PROFILE: timeout ‚úó
    - AFTER START_STREAM: timeout ‚úó
    - AFTER STOP_STREAM: timeout ‚úó
    - All return errno 110 (Operation timed out)
    
[rx] ‚ùå IN endpoint (0x83) not tested due to alt=1 switch error
```

**Previous Test Results** (2025-10-21 ~18:34):
```
[ep0] ‚úÖ STAT v1 readable (64 bytes, alt1=True, out_armed=True)
```

**REGRESSION TIMELINE**:
- 18:34 - STAT v1 (GET_STATUS) was WORKING ‚úÖ
- 18:45 - STAT v1 (GET_STATUS) now BROKEN ‚ùå (errno 110 timeout)
- 18:50 - Confirmed: GET_STATUS broken across ALL test cases

**Root Cause Analysis**:

‚úÖ **What Works**:
- IF#2 USB descriptor correctly defined (class 255, 2 alt settings)
- alt=0‚Üíalt=1 switching functional (vendor SET_ALT command)
- Bulk endpoints (0x03/0x83) active on alt=1
- EP0 GET_STATUS working (STAT v1 readable)
- Firmware compilation and flashing successful

‚úÖ **Fixed**:
- Device firmware **EP0 Bulk OUT handler** (control endpoint request handler)
- Commands now send successfully: SET_PROFILE (0x14), START_STREAM (0x20), etc.
- errno 5 I/O Error no longer appears

‚ùå **What's Broken Now** (CRITICAL - NEW REGRESSION):
- **MAJOR**: EP0 GET_STATUS (IN) is completely broken - 100% timeout rate
  - Returns errno 110 "Operation timed out" on every attempt
  - No delay between calls - happens immediately
  - Was working earlier (~18:34), now broken (~18:50)
  - Indicates device firmware EP0 handler may have crashed or is stuck
- EP0 OUT commands (SET_PROFILE, START_STREAM, STOP_STREAM) still work
- IN endpoint (0x83) cannot be tested due to alt=1 switching error in PyUSB
- Device may be in inconsistent state requiring firmware reload

**Likely Device Firmware Issues** (Updated):

‚úÖ **Fixed** (as of 2025-10-21 ~17:37):
1. EP0 OUT data phase handler - NOW WORKING
2. Control transfer implementation - NOW WORKING
3. Command request validation - NOW WORKING

‚ùå **Needs Fixing**:
1. IN endpoint (0x83) data transmission not active
2. DMA/FIFO configuration for Bulk IN transfers
3. Data buffering/queuing after START_STREAM
4. May need additional initialization command
5. Check if device firmware actually triggers data stream on START_STREAM

**Test Command**:
```bash
lsusb -d cafe:4001 -v | grep "bNumInterfaces\|Interface"
```

**Action Required (Device Developer)**:
1. ‚úÖ Verify firmware source has IF#2 Vendor Bulk descriptor
2. ‚úÖ Check if firmware compilation includes all USB descriptors
3. ‚úÖ Verify flash operation completed successfully
4. ‚úÖ Check device logs for initialization errors
5. ‚úÖ Re-compile and re-flash if needed
6. ‚úÖ Confirm device shows 3 interfaces on fresh USB connect

**Workaround** (temporary):
- Use `USB_receiver.py --plot-fast` with CDC mode (slower, ~20 FPS instead of 200)
- Or wait for device developer to fix firmware

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå BMI30.200.py GUI cannot find IF#2 (blocks oscilloscope display)
- ‚ùå Cannot achieve ~200 FPS visualization
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can fall back to CDC mode but with reduced performance

**Notes**:
- IF#2 briefly appeared in previous firmware iteration, then disappeared
- This suggests firmware update may have reverted or failed
- Both Vendor Bulk and CDC code paths exist in project (confirmed in `usb_vendor/usb_stream.py` and `USB_receiver.py`)

### Action Items (For Device Developer)

**Firmware Status**:
- ‚úÖ New firmware flashed successfully (2025-10-21 ~17:37)
- ‚úÖ IF#2 Vendor Bulk interface now present
- ‚úÖ Endpoints (0x03/0x83) accessible
- ‚ùå EP0 control request handler broken

**Issue Found**:
All EP0 Bulk OUT control commands fail with errno 5 (I/O Error).
This is a **firmware bug** that needs fixing, not a flashing issue.

**Action Required** (device developer):
1. ‚úÖ Review device firmware source code
2. ‚úÖ Find EP0 control OUT request handler implementation
3. ‚úÖ Check:
   - Data phase handling for control transfers
   - Request parsing/validation logic
   - Endpoint HALT/stall conditions
   - Interrupt/DMA conflict on EP0
4. ‚úÖ Fix the bug (likely in stm32 USB driver configuration)
5. ‚úÖ Re-compile firmware
6. ‚úÖ Re-flash device
7. ‚úÖ Test: `python3 BMI30.200.py` should connect and stream data

**Expected Output After Fix**:
```
[open] ‚úÖ IF#2 found
[alt] ‚úÖ alt=1 set
[ep0] ‚úÖ STAT v1 readable
[tx] ‚úÖ Commands succeed (no errno 5!)
[stream] ‚úÖ Data flowing from IN endpoint
[gui] ‚úÖ Oscilloscope displays at ~200 FPS
```

## üü° RESOLVED ISSUES (For Reference)

### Issue #0: EP0 Commands Failing with I/O Error (RESOLVED)

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED (IF#2 was briefly working)

**What Happened**:
- When IF#2 appeared, EP0 bulk OUT commands failed with errno 5
- All command types failed (START_STREAM, STOP_STREAM, SET_PROFILE, SET_FULL_MODE)
- STAT v1 reads worked fine (proving EP0 partially functional)

**Resolution**:
- This was firmware issue on device side
- When IF#2 disappeared, this issue became moot
- Current priority: Get IF#2 back (Issue #1)
